# Hello üëã

I'm Krzysztof ≈ªuraw - self-taught frontend developer. I enjoy working with TypeScript + React.

If I'm not coding I like to brew some good coffee with V60. You can also find me in
various food spots (tasty ones) around Wroc≈Çaw. I also like giving back to community so a few times
I was a mentor on Django Girls (Wroc≈Çaw & Krak√≥w) and used to teach Python at Code Geeks Carrots Wroc≈Çaw.

I like to organize things. I'm coorganizer of Wroc≈Çaw TypeScript meetup.
I'm helping in coordination of Django Girls Wroc≈Çaw.
If you need a place & help with preparing some event do not hesitate to contact me via
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/krzysztof_zuraw) or [LinkedIn](https://pl.linkedin.com/in/krzysztofzuraw).
